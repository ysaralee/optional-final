# CPSC113 Social To-Do App

Thank you Kyle for providing the starter code! It was definitely helpful in constructing the app.

While most of the app comes from the starter code, I made a few changes/implementations (including 
completing the tasks of creating a complete button, and also deleting the task, only if by the owner).

I changed some of the formatting to be a little more uniform throughout (in terms of filling in 
the blanks) and also changed the background color.

# CPSC113 Social todo app

This is my starter app. It is going to be sick.

## How to run this

Get the repo

    git clone https://github.com/kljensen/cpsc113-social-todo-node
    cd cpsc113-social-todo-node

Install the dependencies

    npm install

You'll need to start MongoDB somewhere to store data. And, you'll need to
choose a secret for signing browser cookies.

You can run the server with something similar to

    PORT=$PORT SESSION_SECRET='sdf' MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/social-todo" ./node_modules/.bin/nodemon index.js

where your values of `PORT`, `SESSION_SECRET`, and `MONGO_URL` could be different.
If you are on Cloud9, don't set `PORT`. `SESSION_SECRET` can be whatever you
want.

To see how this app was built, follow these videos. (I should have indexed the
videos by commit so that you could rewind this code. That would tough,
perhaps next time.) This code passes 31 of the tests in the test suite. It
does everything except task completion and deletion. It is roughly 250 lines
long, many of which are comments.

(There are *MANY* ways in which this app could be written. In these videos
I wanted to do it from the "[hello world code](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)"
on the express.js website without using too many fancy dependencies. This is
not the fastest or the smartest way to build the app.

I failed to do a few things in these screencasts. First, I did not show you
the git branch-work-commit workflow as well as I should have. Second, once
I reached the end, I
[cleaned up a few things in this commit](https://github.com/kljensen/cpsc113-social-todo-node/commit/d5ae48f998c13a83c2a52575114875b5ff6e6a1b)
and I did not record myself doing that. You'll notice that clean up involved
adding classes to certain elements and handling a few errors in a way that

You are free to use the code in any way for the first assignment, including as a
starting point for your app. This code *does not* pass tests related to task
completion and deletion. You'll need to complete those.
